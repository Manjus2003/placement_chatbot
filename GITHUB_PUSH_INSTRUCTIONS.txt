# 🚀 GitHub Push Instructions

Follow these steps to push your project to GitHub (excluding .md files).

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Git
Download and install Git from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

After installation, restart your PowerShell terminal.

### 2. Configure Git (First Time Only)
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Steps to Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name it: `placement-companion-chatbot`
4. Keep it **Private** (recommended since it has API keys)
5. Do NOT initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Initialize Local Repository
```bash
cd c:\rag\Placement
git init
```

### Step 3: Rename Main Branch (Optional but recommended)
```bash
git branch -M main
```

### Step 4: Add Files (excluding .md files)
```bash
# The .gitignore file will automatically exclude .md files
git add .
```

### Step 5: Check What Will Be Committed
```bash
git status
```

Verify that .md files are NOT in the list (they should be excluded by .gitignore)

### Step 6: Create First Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Placement Companion Chatbot with Agentic RAG"
```

### Step 7: Add Remote Repository
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/placement-companion-chatbot.git
```

### Step 8: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted for your GitHub credentials:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)

### How to Create Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Give it a name: "Placement Project"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
5. Generate token
6. Copy and save it (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

## Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository URL
2. Check that files are uploaded
3. Verify that .md files are NOT present

## Future Updates

To push new changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Security:**
- Your `environment.env` file with API keys is excluded by .gitignore
- All .md files are excluded as requested
- Keep the repository private if it contains sensitive data

✅ **What's Included:**
- All Python code files (.py)
- Configuration files (requirements.txt)
- Agentic module
- Tool system
- Data processing scripts

❌ **What's Excluded:**
- All .md documentation files
- Environment files with API keys
- Cache files (__pycache__)
- Large data directories (optional)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Git is not recognized"**
- Install Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Restart PowerShell

**Issue: "Authentication failed"**
- Use Personal Access Token, not password
- Make sure token has `repo` permissions

**Issue: "Repository not found"**
- Check the remote URL with: `git remote -v`
- Verify repository name on GitHub

**Issue: ".md files are being pushed"**
- Check .gitignore file exists
- Make sure it contains `*.md`
- Run: `git rm --cached *.md` to remove from staging

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check status
git status

# See what's excluded by gitignore
git status --ignored

# View commit history
git log --oneline

# Remove file from Git (keep local)
git rm --cached filename

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

Good luck with your GitHub upload! 🎉
